Web Application Vulnerability Scanner
An easy-to-use web application vulnerability scanner designed to detect common vulnerabilities in websites. This tool is aimed at penetration testers, security enthusiasts, and developers who want to test their applications for security flaws.
**Features**
Scans for common vulnerabilities:
SQL Injection (SQLi)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Insecure Cookies
Security Header misconfigurations (HSTS, Content Security Policy)
Detailed vulnerability reports with descriptions and possible fixes.
Easy to configure and customize scanning parameters.
Supports scanning of both GET and POST requests.
Automatic detection of forms and user inputs.
**Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vulnerability-scanner.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   cd vulnerability-scanner
3. Install dependencies
Options:
--url: The target URL you want to scan.
--depth: (Optional) Set the scan depth for crawling subpages.
--scan: (Optional) Specify the type of scan (e.g., sql, xss, csrf, etc.).

This tool can detect the following vulnerabilities:

**SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Detects vulnerable input fields that can be exploited with SQL injection payloads.
**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Identifies fields vulnerable to XSS attacks where malicious scripts can be injected.
**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Looks for forms and inputs that lack CSRF protection.
**Open Redirect**: Finds potential redirects that could be exploited to send users to unintended locations.
**Insecure Cookies**: Scans for cookies without Secure or HttpOnly flags, which can be exploited in various attacks.
**Security Headers**: Checks for missing or improperly configured security headers like HSTS and Content Security Policy.
How It Works
The vulnerability scanner performs the following steps:

URL Crawling: It starts by crawling the target website to gather URLs and forms that can be scanned.
Payload Injection: For each detected input field (GET and POST), the scanner injects common payloads to test for vulnerabilities.
Pattern Matching: It checks the responses for specific patterns that indicate a potential vulnerability (e.g., SQL errors, script execution, etc.).
Reporting: Once the scan is complete, a detailed report is generated, listing all the detected vulnerabilities and potential mitigations.
